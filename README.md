# Particle Effects

I wanted to learn how to do animations with Canvas, and found [Franks laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d620nV6bp0A) which shows how to do just that. 

Following along his example, I put some of my own flavor and code design into building a React component to accomplish this.

I plan to keep expanding on this project for different types of animations, and further componentize different aspects of this project.
